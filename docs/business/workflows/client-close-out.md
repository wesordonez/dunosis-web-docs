    This section is still under construction. Facts, information, and data in here may not be complete or accurate yet. 

This workflow documentation outlines the process of closing out a web-development client. It will include a checklist of tasks, templates, and structures to make this process as efficient as possible. 

## 1. Project Deliverables Review

### Overview
Before finalizing a project and handing it over to the client, we conduct a **Project Deliverables Review** to ensure all aspects of the website or application are fully functional, optimized, and meet our quality standards. This step ensures that the client receives a polished, professional product ready for public use.

## 2. Client Approval Process

### Overview  
The **Client Approval Process** is a crucial step before officially closing out the project. This meeting ensures that the client has reviewed the deliverables, tested the functionality, and is satisfied with the outcome. It also provides an opportunity to address any last-minute questions or minor adjustments.

---

### 📅 Scheduling the Final Walkthrough  

To finalize the project, schedule a **Client Approval Meeting** that includes:  

✅ A live walkthrough or recorded video presentation of the final product  
✅ A review of all **Project Deliverables** (checklist completed in the previous step)  
✅ An opportunity for the client to **test functionality** and provide final feedback  

**Best Practices for Scheduling:**  
- **Preferred Format**: Video call (Zoom, Google Meet) or in-person if local  
- **Attendees**: Client, project manager, and key team members  
- **Agenda**: Structured to review final deliverables and next steps  
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes depending on project complexity  

---

### 📝 Client Approval Process  

Once the walkthrough is complete, obtain **official client approval** to mark the project as complete.  

#### 📌 Approval Options  
1. **Verbal Approval**  
   - Ideal for small projects or clients with ongoing contracts.  
   - Confirm in writing via **email** with a summary of the meeting and next steps.  

2. **Written Approval (Recommended for Final Close-Out)**  
   - Send a **Client Approval Form** that includes:  
     - Final project description  
     - Confirmation that all deliverables meet the agreed-upon requirements  
     - Acknowledgment of transition to post-launch support (if applicable)  
   - Approval can be collected via:  
     - **Email Confirmation** (Client replies “Approved”)  
     - **Digital Signature** (Google Forms, DocuSign, PandaDoc)  

**Example Email for Client Approval:**

```markdown
#### Example Email for Client Approval:

Subject: Final Approval - [Project Name]

## 3. Project Documentation

### Overview  
Before closing out a project, ensure that all documentation is properly prepared and accessible to the client. This includes **user manuals, source code documentation, and design specifications**. Providing well-organized documentation enhances the client’s experience, simplifies maintenance, and ensures a smooth transition for any future updates.

---

### 📖 User Manuals & Guides  

The **official project documentation** should be ready and up to date before delivery. This includes: 

✅ An **overview of the system’s functionality**  
✅ Instructions for **managing the website or application**  
✅ Links to **external resources or additional support**  

📌 **Client Documentation Access:**  

Clients should be provided with a direct link to the **official Dunosis documentation page**:  

➡️ **[Dunosis Documentation](https://docs.dunosis.com)**  

Any project-specific manuals should be included in the final delivery folder or as an attached PDF.

---

### 📝 Source Code Documentation  

A well-documented codebase ensures easier maintenance and scalability. Before closing the project, confirm that: 

✅ The **README file** is updated with:  
   - Project description  
   - Installation instructions  
   - Deployment steps  
   - Configuration details (e.g., environment variables)

## 4. Project Archiving

### Overview  
The **Archiving** process ensures that all project files, assets, and code are securely stored and organized before finalizing the close-out. Proper archiving helps maintain historical records, allows for future retrieval, and provides clients with a structured package of deliverables.

---

### 📂 Organizing & Storing Project Files  

Before completing the project, all relevant files should be stored in a centralized location for historical reference.  

✅ **Backup all project files, including:**  

- Source code and **final commit history**  
- Design files (Figma, logos, branding assets)  
- Documentation (manuals, README, and setup guides)  
- Any other project-related assets (images, videos, fonts, third-party integrations)  

📌 **Storage Location:**  

All files should be **uploaded to Google Drive** under the **Dunosis Historical Content** folder in the corresponding client folder:

➡️ **[Google Drive Archive](https://drive.google.com/your-folder-link-here)**  

**Folder Structure Example:**  

```plaintext
📂 Project_Archive
├── Codebase
│   ├── final_source_code.zip
│   ├── repository_backup.git
│   ├── readme.md
├── Assets
│   ├── branding/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── videos/
├── Documentation
│   ├── project_manual.pdf
│   ├── setup_guide.pdf
├── Design
│   ├── figma_link.txt
│   ├── exported_assets.zip
```

- Provide a download link from a **secure cloud storage service**  

---

### 🔒 Privatizing the GitHub Repository  

Once the project is archived and delivered:  

✅ **Change repository visibility to private** (unless agreed otherwise with the client)  
   - Navigate to **GitHub Repo → Settings → Change Repository Visibility**  
   - Confirm the action to restrict future public access  

✅ **Remove external collaborators** (if necessary)  
   - Check **Settings → Manage Access**  
   - Remove non-team members  

✅ **Transfer ownership (if applicable)**  
   - If the client is taking full ownership, transfer the repository to their GitHub organization.
