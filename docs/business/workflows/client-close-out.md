!!! warning ":construction: Under Construction :construction:"

    This section is still under construction. Facts, information, and data in here may not be complete or accurate yet. 

This workflow documentation outlines the process of closing out a web-development client. It will include a checklist of tasks, templates, and structures to make this process as efficient as possible. 

## 1. Project Deliverables Review

### Overview
Before finalizing a project and handing it over to the client, we conduct a **Project Deliverables Review** to ensure all aspects of the website or application are fully functional, optimized, and meet our quality standards. This step ensures that the client receives a polished, professional product ready for public use.

### 🛡 Quality Assurance (QA) Standards

Before final delivery, the project undergoes **Quality Assurance Testing** to ensure it meets our high standards. The following checks should be performed:

#### 1. **Cross-Browser Testing**  
 - Verify site performance on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
 - Ensure compatibility with both Windows and macOS environments.

#### 2. **Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness**  
   - Test using multiple device screen sizes (can use Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack, or actual devices).
   - Ensure buttons, text, and images scale correctly.

#### 3. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Run a **Google PageSpeed Insights** test and address any major issues.
    - Mobile versions must have higher than 85 score
    - Desktop versions must have higher than 95 score
   - Optimize **CSS, JavaScript, and images** for faster loading.

#### 4. **Security Testing**  
   - Ensure all form inputs are validated to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
   - Check for exposed API keys or sensitive data in the source code.

#### 5. **Final Client Review**  
   - Conduct a walkthrough with the client.
   - Gather feedback and make any last-minute refinements.

## 2. Client Approval Process

### Overview  
The **Client Approval Process** is a crucial step before officially closing out the project. This meeting ensures that the client has reviewed the deliverables, tested the functionality, and is satisfied with the outcome. It also provides an opportunity to address any last-minute questions or minor adjustments.

---

### 📅 Scheduling the Final Walkthrough  

To finalize the project, schedule a **Client Approval Meeting** that includes:  

✅ A live walkthrough or recorded video presentation of the final product  
✅ A review of all **Project Deliverables** (checklist completed in the previous step)  
✅ An opportunity for the client to **test functionality** and provide final feedback  

**Best Practices for Scheduling:**  
- **Preferred Format**: Video call (Zoom, Google Meet) or in-person if local  
- **Attendees**: Client, project manager, and key team members  
- **Agenda**: Structured to review final deliverables and next steps  
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes depending on project complexity  

---

### 📝 Client Approval Process  

Once the walkthrough is complete, obtain **official client approval** to mark the project as complete.  

#### 📌 Approval Options  
1. **Verbal Approval**  
   - Ideal for small projects or clients with ongoing contracts.  
   - Confirm in writing via **email** with a summary of the meeting and next steps.  

2. **Written Approval (Recommended for Final Close-Out)**  
   - Send a **Client Approval Form** that includes:  
     - Final project description  
     - Confirmation that all deliverables meet the agreed-upon requirements  
     - Acknowledgment of transition to post-launch support (if applicable)  
   - Approval can be collected via:  
     - **Email Confirmation** (Client replies “Approved”)  
     - **Digital Signature** (Google Forms, DocuSign, PandaDoc)  

**Example Email for Client Approval:**

```markdown
#### Example Email for Client Approval:

Subject: Final Approval - [Project Name]

## 3. Project Documentation

### Overview  
Before closing out a project, ensure that all documentation is properly prepared and accessible to the client. This includes **user manuals, source code documentation, and design specifications**. Providing well-organized documentation enhances the client’s experience, simplifies maintenance, and ensures a smooth transition for any future updates.

---

### 📖 User Manuals & Guides  

The **official project documentation** should be ready and up to date before delivery. This includes: 

✅ An **overview of the system’s functionality**  
✅ Instructions for **managing the website or application**  
✅ Links to **external resources or additional support**  

📌 **Client Documentation Access:**

   - Deployment steps  
   - Configuration details (e.g., environment variables)
