#### Adding New Content

To add new content, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Markdown file (`.md`) in the `docs` directory under the appropriate directory by desired section. Name the file appropriately based on the content it will contain.
2. Open the new file in your preferred text editor.
3. Add the content you want to include. Use Markdown syntax to format the text, add headings, lists, links, images, etc.
4. Save the new file.
5. Update the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file to include the new file in the navigation. Add an entry under the `nav` section, specifying the title and the path to the new file. For example:
    ```yaml
    nav:
      - Home: index.md
      - New Page: new_page.md
    ```
6. Commit the new file and the updated configuration file with a meaningful commit message.
